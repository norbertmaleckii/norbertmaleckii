### Hello! üëã

My name is **Norbert**. I'm a Software Engineer specialized in building backend side of real-time apps using Ruby, Rails, AnyCable, Sidekiq, Redis and PostgreSQL. At present, I am responsible for managing AWS configuration, providing complex REST API, integrating external services, building performant SQL queries, refactoring existing functionalities to meet with new enhancements, sending live data through WebSockets, analyzing app performance, caring about regular update of dependencies and bringing into project better code standards.

I have been dealing with programming since the second grade of secondary school, i.e. from 2012, where I started my adventure with programming with the C++ language. Then, I graduated from AGH University of Science and Technology with a Bachelor of Engineering in Applied Computer Science. During studies I mostly continued learning C++ language and C++ STL library. I have been fascinated with parallel programming since I started studies.

I became interested in Ruby and have been working with it since 2015. I'm always a helpful, proactive and detail-oriented person with problem-solving skills. I'm continuously on the path to gain new knowledge which helps me provide more accurate solutions. I'm also keenly interested in Software Architecture including cohesive coding standards, clean boundaries between subsystems and infrastructure as a code.
