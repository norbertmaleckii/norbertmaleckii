### Hello! üëã

My name is **Norbert**. I'm a Software Engineer specialized in building real-time apps using Ruby, Rails, AnyCable, Sidekiq, Redis and PostgreSQL. 

I have been dealing with programming since the second grade of secondary school, i.e. from 2012, where I started my adventure with programming with the C++ language. Then, I graduated from AGH University of Science and Technology with a Bachelor of Engineering in Applied Computer Science. During studies I was mostly keep going with C++ language and C++ STL library. The studies left a fascination with parallel programming to these days.

I started to be interested in Ruby in order to be able to quickly provide the client with a ready-made solution thats why I have started working with Ruby since 2015. I'm always helpfull, proactive and detail-oriented person with problem-solving skills. I'm continuously on the path to learn new knowledge which help me to provide more accurate solutions. I'm also seriously interested in Software Architecture including cohesive coding standards, clean boundaries between sub-systems and infrastrusture as a code.
