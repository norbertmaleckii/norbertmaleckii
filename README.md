### Hello! üëã

My name is **Norbert**. I'm a Software Engineer specialized in building backend side of real-time apps using Ruby, Rails, AnyCable, Sidekiq, Redis and PostgreSQL. At present, I am responsible for managing AWS configuration, providing complex REST API, integrating external services, building performant SQL queries, refactoring existing functionalities to meet with new enhancements, sending live data through WebSockets, analyzing app performance, caring about regular update of dependencies and bringing into project better code standards.

I have been dealing with programming since the second grade of secondary school, i.e. from 2012, where I started my adventure with programming with the C++ language. Then, I graduated from AGH University of Science and Technology with a Bachelor of Engineering in Applied Computer Science. During studies I kept going with C++ language and C++ STL library. The studies left a fascination with parallel programming to these days.

I started to be interested in Ruby in order to be able to quickly provide the client with a ready-made solution that's why I have started working with Ruby since 2015. I'm always a helpful, proactive and detail-oriented person with problem-solving skills. I'm continuously on the path to learn new knowledge which helps me to provide more accurate solutions. I'm also seriously interested in Software Architecture including cohesive coding standards, clean boundaries between subsystems and infrastructure as a code.
